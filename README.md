## Question 1
The most influential book I’ve read regarding web development is on Javascript & jQuery by Jon Duckett. The book dives into how to use JavaScript to make web pages more interactive, interesting, and usable. In today’s modern programming world, web pages that are interactive and nail the front-end side of the site on the head, are for more interesting and manage to capture the attention of the user in a greater capacity. This book has influenced my progression into programming immensely by giving me elegant structure to study, and encapturing me into the beauty of web development.

## Question 2
I built a web application called MyLift in the hopes of changing how gym-goers approach working out. I am a certified strength and conditioning specialist and certified personal trainer who wanted to create an application to make fitness programming easier for the general public. I overcame great adversity by learning to program in a completely foreign language (Ember.js). By referring to documentation and asking help from my old college roommates, or joining Slack communities, I was able to seek out help to any problems I ran into and accomplished what I had set out to do. I learned a great deal from planning the application, implementing my ideas, and restructuring the application as I came across necessary changes.

## Question 3
```
def unordered_list(strings):
  # creating unordered list tag
  ulst = '<ul>'

  # iterate over strings
  for s in strings:
    ulst += '<li>%s</li>' % s

  ulst += '</ul>'
  return ulst
```
If we are given a list, the function should check whether is was given by user input and if the input is in list form.

## Question 4
XSRF or cross-site request forgery occurs when an attacker pretends to be another user in order to gain access during authentication. In order to resolve this problem, we can send a generated state token with the authentication request to be checked when the response is returned.

DDoS attacks occur when the attacker spams the web server with requests until it can’t serve content anymore. Many DDoS attacks are hard to protect against. However, if the server being attacked is of higher caliber, it would take a lot before being flooded with too much to handle.

## Question 5
```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

import json
import random


@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
  return 'Hello World!'

# Route takes the number of sides on the die as a single argument
@app.route('/roll_the_dice/<int:sides>/json')
def roll_the_dice(sides):

  # Assign the result of the die roll
  dice1 = random.randint(1,sides)
  dice2 = random.randint(1,sides)

  # Return the results of the dice rolled as a json string
  return json.dumps({'dice1': dice1, 'dice2': dice2}, sort_keys=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.debug = True
  app.run()
```
The route added includes functionality to roll the two dice and return the end result as a json string using json.dumps(). Each roll of the dice is assigned to one of the two dice.

## Question 6
In a year from now, I will have finished a couple more Nanodegrees through Udacity in the subjects of ReactJS and Swift. I want to expand my skills as a software developer into mobile development. Much of what I read on the direction of software development has influenced me to pursue ReactJS. I never want to stay stagnant in my career. Every single day I will be working to become a better programmer. Eventually, I would like to be in a leadership role that would allow me to share my knowledge with someone who started out where I did. With all that I have learned and continue to learn, I will use my skills to create exceptional websites and web applications that the company I work for can take pride in.
